## Problem Statement
Novice chefs tend to not know what they can make with the ingredients that they have. This leads to wasted food and more money spent on eating out. Our system will be different from existing products by focusing on finding unique dishes really quickly based on what you have in your house right now.

## Project Objectives
- Retrieve recipes from third-party databases based on the food and tools that the user has
- Limit search results by food allergies, calorie count, and willingness to purchase more ingredients
- Keep track of user accounts and recipe metadata in a custom database
- Personalized recommendations and improved search results based on user actions

## Stakeholders
- Users: everyone who has a hard time cooking for themselves
- Developers, Project Owners: Garrick Buckley, Mason Herhusky, Jack Horton, Garrett Lewis, Graham Park, Darrell Shi

## Deliverables
- iOS and Android apps built in Xamarin
- Web app
- Backend API
- User database built in MySQL
